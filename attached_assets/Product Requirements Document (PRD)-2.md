## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications and requirements for the Rider-Seeker app, a mobile application that combines ride-sharing functionality with social matching capabilities. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development, testing, and deployment of the application.

### 1.2 Scope
The Rider-Seeker app aims to create a unique platform where users can offer or seek rides while also potentially forming social connections. The app will support two primary user roles: Riders (who offer rides) and Seekers (who find rides). The initial release will focus on core functionality to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a one-week development timeline.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **Rider:** User who offers rides and completes KYC verification
- **Seeker:** User who finds and requests rides
- **KYC:** Know Your Customer, identity verification process
- **Match:** When a Seeker and Rider express mutual interest
- **MVP:** Minimum Viable Product
